#STROBE document for the templating of observational trials cross-sectional/case-control and cohort studies:


#STROBE Statement—checklist of items that should be included in reports of observational studies


#Title and abstract
#(a) Indicate the study’s design with a commonly used term in the title or the abstract

#Example 1
#Title: ‘An observational study with long-term follow-up of
#canine cognitive dysfunction: Clinical characteristics, survival
#and risk factors’ (Fast et al., 2013).
#Example 2
#Title: ‘Case-control study of risk factors associated with
#Brucella melitensis on goat farms in Peninsular Malaysia’
#(Bamaiyi et al., 2014).

#Explanation
#Including the study design term in the title or abstract when
#a standard study design is used, or at least identifying that a
#study is observational, allows the reader to easily identify the
#design and helps to ensure that articles are correctly indexed
#in electronic databases (Benson and Hartz, 2000). In STROBE,
#item 1a only requests that a common study design term be used.
#However, in veterinary research, not all observational studies are
#easily categorized into cohort, case–control, or cross-sectional
#study designs. Therefore, we recommend including that the study
#was observational and, if possible, the study design or important
#design characteristics, for example longitudinal, in the title.


#(b). Indicate why the study was conducted, the approach, the results, the limitations and the relevance of the findings


#Example
#Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius
#(MRSP) has emerged as a highly drug-resistant small animal
#veterinary pathogen. Although often isolated from
#outpatients in veterinary clinics, there is concern that
#MRSP follows a veterinary-hospital associated epidemiology.
#This study’s objective was to identify risk factors for
#MRSP infections in dogs and cats in Germany. Clinical
#isolates of MRSP cases (n = 150) and methicillin-susceptible
#S. pseudintermedius (MSSP) controls (n = 133) and
#their corresponding host signalment and medical data
#covering the six months prior to staphylococcal isolation
#were analysed by multivariable logistic regression. The
#identity of all MRSP isolates was confirmed through
#demonstration of S. intermedius-group specific nuc and
#mecA. In the final model, cats (compared to dogs, OR
#18.5, 95% CI 1.8–188.0, P = 0.01), animals that had been
#hospitalised (OR 104.4, 95% CI 21.3–511.6, P < 0.001),
#or visited veterinary clinics more frequently (>10 visits
#OR 7.3, 95% CI 1.0–52.6, P = 0.049) and those that had
#received topical ear medication (OR 5.1, 95% CI 1.8–
#14.9, P = 0.003) or glucocorticoids (OR 22.5, 95% CI
#7.0–72.6, P < 0.001) were at higher risk of MRSP infection,
#whereas S. pseudintermedius isolates from ears were
#more likely to belong to the MSSP group (OR 0.09, 95%
#CI 0.03–0.34, P < 0.001). These results indicate an
#association of MRSP infection with veterinary clinic/hospital
#settings and possibly with chronic skin disease.
#There was an unexpected lack of association between
#MRSP and antimicrobial therapy; this requires further
#investigation . . ... (Lehner et al., 2014).
#
#Explanation
#The abstract provides key information that enables readers
#to understand the key aspects of the study and decide
#whether to read the article. In STROBE, item 1b recommended
#that authors provide an informative and balanced
#summary of what experiments were done, what results were
#found and the implications of the findings in the abstract.
#In STROBE-Vet, this item was modified to provide more
#guidance on the key components that should be addressed.
#The study design should be stated; however, if the study
#does not correspond to a named study design such as case–
#control, cross-sectional and cohort study, then the author
#should describe the key elements of the study design such
#as incident versus prevalent cases, and whether or not the
#selection was based on outcome status (Pearce, 2012). The
#abstract should succinctly describe the study objectives,
#including the primary objective and primary outcome, the
#exposure(s) of interest, relevant population information
#such as species and the purpose (or uses) of the animals,
#the study location and dates, and the number of study
#units. In addition, including the organizational level at
#which the outcome was measured (e.g. herd, pen or individual)
#is recommended. The presented results should
#include summary outcome measures (e.g. frequency or
#appropriate descriptor of central tendency such as mean or
#median) and, if relevant, a clear description of the association
#direction along with accompanying association measures
#(e.g. odds ratio) and measures of precision (e.g. 95%
#confidence interval) rather than P-value alone. We discourage
#stating that an exposure is or is not significantly associated
#with an outcome without appropriate statistical
#measures. Finally, because many veterinary observational
#studies evaluate multiple potential risk factors, the abstract
#should provide the number of exposure–outcome associations
#tested to alert the end-user to potential type I error in
#the study. When multiple outcomes are observed, provide
#the reader with a rationale for the outcomes presented in
#the abstract, for example only statistically significant results
#or the outcome of the primary hypothesis is presented.

  ####Introduction####
##### 1.Background/rationale  ####
#Explain the scientific background and rationale for the investigation being reported

#Example
#The syndesmochorial placenta of cattle prevents the bovine
#fetus from receiving immunoglobulins in utero; therefore,
#calves are born essentially agammaglobulinemic [].1 Calves
#acquire passive immunity by consuming colostrum in the
#first 24 to 36 h of life []. Inadequate colostrum consumption
#leads to failure of passive transfer (FPT), which has detrimental
#effects on calf health and survival. As many as 40% of dairy
#calves experience FPT []. However, beef and dairy calf management
#is considerably different, as beef calves generally remain
#with the cow post-calving and nurse ad libitum, while dairy
#producers often separate calves from their dams and then
#provide the colostrum. Hence, the prevalence of and risk factors
#for FPT in beef calves may vary substantially from those in
#reports describing dairy calves. . ..’ (Waldner and Rosengren,
#2009).
#Explanation
#The scientific background provides important context for
#readers. It describes the focus and gives an overview of what
#is known on a topic and what gaps in current knowledge
#are addressed by the study. Background material should
#note recent pertinent studies and any reviews of pertinent
#studies. The background section should also include the
#anticipated impact of the work.




#####2.Objectives  #####
#State specific objectives, including any prespecified hypotheses

#1. Background/rationale: explain the scientific background
#and rationale for the investigation being reported.


#2 (a). Objectives: state-specific objectives, including any
#primary or secondary pre-specified hypotheses or their
#absence
#Example
#The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of
#track way distance and cover on the probability for lameness
#in Danish dairy herds using grazing. We hypothesised that
#short track distances with added cover would be associated
#with the lowest lameness prevalence (Burow et al., 2014).
#Explanation
#Objectives are the detailed aims of the study. Well-crafted
#objectives specify populations, exposures and outcomes,
#and parameters that will be estimated. They might be formulated
#as specific hypotheses or as questions that the
#study was designed to address. In some situations, objectives
#might be less specific, for example in early discovery
#phases. Regardless, the report should clearly reflect the
#investigators’ original intentions.
#2 (b). Ensure that the level of organization is clear for eachobjective and hypothesis
#Example
#There were three objectives for this study: (1) to quantify the
#standing and lying behavior, with particular emphasis on
#post-milking standing time, of dairy cows milked 3 9 /d,
#(2) to determine the cow- and herd-level factors associated
#with lying behavior, and (3) to relate these findings to the
#risk of experiencing an elevation in somatic cell count (SCC)
#(Watters et al., 2013).

#Explanation
#A full explanation is provided in Box 4: Organization structures
#in animal populations

  ####Methods####

####1. Study design####
#Present key elements of study design early in the paper

#Example
#A cohort study was performed on two farrow-to-finish
#farms (A and B) in two farrowing rooms (cohorts) per
#farm. Sows were examined for the presence of A. pleuropnemoniae
#infection by collection of blood and tonsil brush
#samples approximately three weeks before parturition. The
#proportions of colonization at litter and individual piglet
#level were determined three days before weaning and associations
#with dam parity and sow serum and brush sample
#results were evaluated (Tobias et al., 2014).
#Explanation
#We advise presenting key elements of study design early
#in the methods section (or at the end of the introduction)
#so that readers can understand the basics of the
#study. For example, if the authors used a cohort study
#design, which followed animals or animal groups over a
#particular time period, they should describe the group
#that comprised the cohort and their exposure status.
#Similarly, if the investigation used a case–control design,
#the cases and controls and their source population(s)
#should be described.
#If a study is a variant of the three main study types
#(cohort, case–control or cross-sectional), there is an
#additional need for clarity. Authors can provide a clear
#description of the study design by including the following
#key elements: (i) the timing of study population
#enrolment with respect to the occurrence of the outcome
#such as after or prior to, (ii) the role of exposure status
#on enrolment such as enrolled based on exposure or
#not, (iii) the role of outcome status on enrolment such
#as enrolled based on outcome or not, (iv) the timing of
#outcome and exposure determination such as outcome
#determined before, after or concurrent to exposure determination
#and (v) if the outcome is a disease, condition or
#behaviour, whether the outcome represents incidence or
#prevalence. If the study only estimates prevalence or incidence
#in a single group, then the authors need to clarify
#whether the outcome represents incidence or prevalence.
#This item is intended to give the reader a general idea of
#the study design. The design specifics are described in
#detail in subsequent items.
#We recommend that authors refrain from calling a
#study ‘prospective’ or ‘retrospective’ because these terms
#are ill defined (Vandenbroucke, 1991). One usage sees
#cohort and prospective as synonymous and reserves the
#word retrospective for case–control studies. A second
#usage distinguishes prospective and retrospective cohort
#studies according to the timing of data collection relative
#to when the idea for the study was developed (Miettinen,
#1985). A third usage distinguishes prospective and retrospective
#case–control studies depending on whether the
#data about the exposure of interest existed when cases
#were selected (Rothman and Greenland, 1998).
#In STROBE-Vet, we do not use the words prospective
#and retrospective, nor alternatives such as concurrent and
#historical. We recommend that whenever authors use these
#words, they define what they mean. Most importantly, we
#recommend that authors describe exactly how and when
#data collection took place.


####2. Setting ####
#Describe the 
#setting, 
#locations, and relevant dates, including periods of recruitment, 
#exposure, 
#follow-up, 
#and data collection


#Example
#This study was conducted in Afar and Tigray regions
#in north-eastern Ethiopia. Two administrative zones
#(Zone-1 and Zone-4) out of five zones of Afar region
#were included in the study, and then one district from
#each zone was selected (Asiyta and Yallo, respectively).
#Asayita district was selected to include an agro-pastoral
#production system where irrigation farming is widely
#prevalent. . . . Yallo was selected for its location interfacing
#with the highland agro-climate in Alamata and Raya
#Azebo districts where the livestock are moved for grazing
#and watering during dry season [ ]. There were two distinct
#agro-ecological climates prevailing in the Afar study
#area: lowland (<1500 m) and highland (>2300 m). . . .
#A cross-sectional study was carried out between October
#2011 and February 2012 to assess epidemiological factors
#associated with observed [lumpy skin disease] in the previous
#two years (September 2009 to October 2011). Three to
#four Kebeles (the lowest administrative unit next to district
#in order of hierarchy in Ethiopia) were selected randomly
#from each district, and 20-30 herds were randomly selected
#from each Kebele. Herd-owners were selected based on
#willingness to complete the questionnaire (Hailu et al.,
#2014).
#Explanation
#Readers must understand the clinical, demographic,
#managerial, geographic and temporal contexts in which
#the study was conducted, so readers will be able to
#determine the populations to which the study’s inferences
#can be applied. Data from research herds or kennels
#might not extrapolate to commercial or home
#settings. Dates are required to understand the historical
#context of the research, because medical, sociological
#and agricultural practices can change over time, which,
#in turn, can affect the prevalence of risk factors, potential
#confounders, diseases and study methods. Knowing
#when a study took place and over what period participants
#were recruited and followed places the study in
#historical context and is important for the interpretation
#of results.



####3. Participants ####
#(a) Cohort study—Give the eligibility criteria, and the sources and methods of selection of participants. 
#Describe methods of follow-up
#Case-control study—Give the eligibility criteria, and the sources and methods of case ascertainment and control selection. 
#Give the rationale for the choice of cases and controls
#Cross-sectional study—Give the eligibility criteria, and the sources and methods of selection of participants


#(b) Cohort study—For matched studies, give matching criteria and number of exposed and unexposed
#Case-control study—For matched studies, give matching criteria and the number of controls per case

#Example
#Counties were chosen based on the proportion of registered
#backyard flock owners and location of commercial industries
#and auction markets. In May 2011, the Maryland
#Department of Agriculture (MDA) confidentially mailed
#1,000 informational letters and return postcards to poultry
#owners enrolled in the Maryland Poultry Registration Program.
#Participants were eligible for the study if they lived in
#Maryland, owned domesticated fowl, and maintained a
#flock size fewer than 1,000 birds (Madsen et al., 2013).
#Explanation
#Eligibility criteria might be presented as inclusion and
#exclusion criteria, although this distinction is not always
#necessary or useful. Regardless, we advise authors to report
#all eligibility criteria and also to describe the group from
#which the study population was selected (e.g. the general
#population of a region or country), and the method of
#recruitment (e.g. referral or self-selection through advertisements).
#Authors of studies involving animal populations
#should describe the eligibility criteria at all
#organizational levels (e.g. farm, pen, stable or clinic) for the
#animals included, and for smaller units within included
#animals, such as limbs or mammary quarters, if applicable
#(see Box 4: Organization structures in animal populations).
